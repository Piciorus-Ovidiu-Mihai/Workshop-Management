# Workshop-Management
This is an application for manage the workshops.

## What I used for the application
Firstly, I made register and login with firebase. I have a menu with Navigation Drawer. I used Fragments for each page and Constraint Layout for arranging all buttons, plaintext,textview,recyclerview and cards view. Also , I integrate Camera for taking photos.
These are only some things I used in my application,behind all logical operations to make this application to work properly.
